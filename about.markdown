Mashup Studios is a new indie game studio based in Central Florida. We are currently working on two games: Dungeons & Blasters and Orbital Approach.

Dungeons & Blasters is a larger project that focuses on bringing together a team-based first person shooter vs a person playing as DM in an RPG.

Orbital Approach is a calm, casual game where you aim your spaceship to navigate around the universe solving increasingly difficult puzzles; including interacting with planets, black holes, white holes, solar winds wormholes and more.
